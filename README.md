# MEGA65 = Enhanced c65 running in FPGA.
 
This core is an Altera FPGA version based on [Mega65 core](https://github.com/MEGA65/mega65-core) from Xilinx FPGA Artix7 200 

Thanks to [Yo_me](https://github.com/naeloob) for solving the graphic glitches, the support of [Paul Gardner-Stephen](HTTP://mega65.org) and [RetroWiki DevTeam](https://www.retrowiki.es/).
Thanks to [Manuel Teira](https://github.com/teiram) for helping me with the SDRAM controller for the SDRAM Winbond W9825G6KH used in the EP4GX150 QMTECH board.

You will optionally need the a MEGA65 ROM file, if you wish to use BASIC65:
https://files.mega65.org?id=54e69439-f25e-4124-8c78-22ea7ddc0f1c

If you do not have such a file, the MEGA65 contains the free and open-source
OpenROM alternative.

# Automated Build Server

The MEGA65 project maintains an automated build server at https://builder.mega65.org/

You will optionally need the a C65 ROM file,

Here you have the instructions on how to get the MEGA65 ROM even if you don't own a MEGA65:
https://files.mega65.org/?ar=145591dd-deb6-4bd0-aa89-8e39cd021470

If you wish to use BASIC 10:
http://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/firmware/computers/c65/911001.bin  
renamed to MEGA65.ROM, is 128k in size

If you do not have such a file, the MEGA65 contains the free and open-source
OpenROM alternative.
